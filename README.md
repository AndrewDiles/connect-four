# Connect-Four

As implied, this repository houses a connect-four game.

## MVP

The user will be able to:
- ✅ play against another player (hot-seat)
- ✅ play against a bot
- ✅ watch two bots play (this mode is hidden)
- ✅ navigate through the history of moves
- ✅ select chip colors

## Stretch Goals

- include sound effect / volume control
- ✅ landscape responsive design for mobile
- ✅ easy keyboard navigation (during game)
- ✅ bot difficulty (this mode is hidden)

## Hidden Modes

During game mode selection (bots, pvp, etc), there is a hidden `input` at the bottom of the screen.

Enter the code: __harder bots__ to use an improved bot algorithm.

Enter the code: __unlock bots__ to unlock bot vs bot matches.

**Vite's Default Content Below Here**

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
